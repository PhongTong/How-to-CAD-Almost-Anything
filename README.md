# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT IAP 2024
This repository serves as the workshop website for How to CAD Almost Anything! Here, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Solidworks files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet-engine? A test dummy? How about making an animation of a LEGO house building itself? Or making a realistic render of a bowl of fruit? In this MIT AeroAstro workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 9 2-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new Solidworks skills, while the second half will see the application of these news skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, but about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

Through the workshop’s 9 sessions, the goal is for the student to:
* Have learned all the essential Solidworks skills, enough to be able to pass the industry-standard Mechanical Design [CSWA](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswa-mechanical-design) exam.
* Have built a comprehensive design portfolio, in the form of a presentation (see Workshop Portfolio (optional) section below), to showcase all the different in-class projects and Solidworks skills mastered.
* Feel that it can take any object and exclaim, “I know how to CAD this!”.

### Session 1: Introduction to Solidworks.
(Tuesday, January 16)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll get ourselves acquainted with the Solidworks workspace, and start learning some of the most used tools. Session 1's goals include:
* Creating sketches (using basic shapes, construction lines, smart-dimensioning, sketch relationships) and understanding planes.
* Understanding what it means for a sketch to be fully defined.
* Locating and using the different elementary feature commands (boss extrude, boss cut, fillet, chamfer).
* Editing sketches and features after creating them.
* Coloring parts and changing material properties.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 1, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A cake
*	An iPhone 6 (give it a shot just by looking at a picture online)
*	A pencil (using an engineering drawing)

**To do (optional):** Create a presentation (Powerpoint/Google Slides) and title it “Projects Portfolio”.  There, add 3 slides, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

**Class Recordings:** To be posted.

**Class Slides:** To be posted.

### Session 2: Splines, Sketch Pictures, and some Geography!
(Wednesday, January 17)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll continue exploring some of the most powerful Solidworks tools. Session 2’s goals include:
*	Learning how to use the spline tool.
*	Learning how to add a picture and sketch on it.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 2, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A 3D model of a topographical geographical map, such as the [Big Island in Hawaii](https://seanshawaiianvacation.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/5/9/13590030/6795329_orig.gif).
*	A keychain of your favorite logo. 

**To do (optional):** Add 2 slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

**Class Recordings:** To be posted.

**Class Slides:** To be posted.

### Session 3: All about symmetry, patterns and planes (that don’t fly)
(Friday, January 19)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll focus our attention to symmetry, patterns and planes, and how we can leverage certain tools to simplify the design process. Session 3’s goals include: 
*	Understanding how to create a sketch for a revolve.
*	Learning how to make use of the mirroring and circular patterns tools, both as a sketch and as a feature.
*	Learning how to create planes, at different angles.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 3, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	An airplane constant-area airfoil fidget spinner (using spline, sketch picture, revolve and circular pattern) with split-scimitar winglets and a jet-engine!
*	A carbon nanotube (honeycomb) tower (using circular and linear patterns and planes).

**To do (optional):** Add 2 slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

**Class Recordings:** To be posted.

**Class Slides:** To be posted.

### Session 4: Loft, not lift!
(Monday, January 22)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll explore two very powerful Solidworks tools, loft and sweep. These tools allow us to create complicated looking geometries, like the body of a 747 or the surface of an apple. Session 4’s goals include: 
*	Learning how to use the lofting and sweep command.
*	Continuing to master previously explored tools, such as revolve, linear/circular patterns and plane creation.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on S4, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A 3D model from a [boat hull 2D plan](https://www.fao.org/3/V9468E/v9468e04.gif).
*	An airport control tower (using loft, sweep, revolve, and patterns).
*	A banana, in honor of the banana lounge (using various plane cuts, splines and lofts).

**To do (optional):** Add 3 slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

**Class Recordings:** To be posted.

**Class Slides:** To be posted.
